# Welcome to Your New React Project

This project was initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can execute the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Launches the development server.\
Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your app.

The page will automatically reload if you make edits.\
You may also notice lint warnings in the console.

### `npm test`

Starts the test runner in watch mode.\
Refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) documentation for more details.

### `npm run build`

Creates a production-ready build of your app in the `build` directory.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and filenames include hashes.\
Your application is now ready to be deployed!

For more information, see the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot revert!**

If you need to customize the build configuration, you can eject the app. This command will copy all the configuration files and dependencies (like webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them. All other scripts will still work, but they will refer to the copied scripts, which you can modify.

Ejecting is not mandatory. The default configuration is designed to handle small to medium-sized projects, so only eject if you need more customization.
